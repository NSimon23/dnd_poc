# Starting the Drag and Drop POC

This project was created as a POC for drag and drop for People.Health

# file-server

The tiles in the react-dnd app are populated by files in the file server public/uploads directory. 

To run the file server:

### `npm start`

# react-dnd

This is the react app that implements drag and drop.

To run the react app:

### `npm start`

This will launch the react app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Initially there will be no tiles to drag and drop.

Click the `add files` button on the bottom of the react app to upload one or multiple tiles\
that will become tiles to drag and drop.
